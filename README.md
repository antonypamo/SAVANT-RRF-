# SAVANT-RRF — Resonance Realty Framework (Research Scaffold)

This repository is a research scaffold for prototyping nodal architectures (icosahedral/dodecahedral),
resonance simulations, musical-frequency adaptations, and symbolic mapping of space-time concepts.
It is NOT an AGI. Use for research and simulation only.

Structure:
- core/: engine, memory, mappings, evolution
- datasets/: node coordinates, frequencies, constants
- theory/: markdown with conceptual notes
- simulations/: numeric experiments and visualizations
- main.py: demo entrypoint

Requirements: see requirements.txt
